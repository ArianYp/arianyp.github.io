# ðŸ‘‹ About Me

I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, supervised by [**Dr. Basim Azam**](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1065421-basim-azam) and [**Prof. Naveed Akhtar**](https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/profile/1050019-naveed-akhtar).  

My thesis investigates approaches to enhance the robustness of AI models, with a particular focus on **multimodal large language models** and **diffusion-based generative models**. My broader research interests include **trustworthy machine learning**, dataset design, and the development of reliable deep generative systems.
